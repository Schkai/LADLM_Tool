# LADLM_Tool
Tool to organize items in a pen and paper game.

Yeah, not really a pen and paper pen when you're using tools to organize your stuff but my group's just lazy as that.
This tool is for organizing items, preferably used by the GM.


TODO:
- implement working buttons
- create XML database for storing stuff
- create randomizer function for random loot drops
- create dice rolling mechanism (just for experimentation or secret dice rolling by GM)
- multi language support?
